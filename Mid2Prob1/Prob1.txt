The output of my program is shown in the screen shot included in this zip file. I decided to implement this funciton
using a helper function in order to be able to access the root node. I perfomed this function in a recursive manner for max 
efficency. The helper is called  int sumRangeHelper(int min, int max), is public and takes in the max and min. The main sumRange 
function is private and also takes in the root node. I tested on the two examples given, and i tested to make 
sure when there were no nodes in the range, that the function is just 0. I also tested on an empty tree and got the right answers.
I created my code in cloud 9.
