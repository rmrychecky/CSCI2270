Time Complexity: O(n)

My solution uses first, a function that will go through and find the leftmost node to start at, and then a function that 
actually connects each node at a level. The root of a tree will always have the next pointer set to NULL since it is the
only node at that level, and then while a node has children, its children will will be linked up. My solution is iterative
and a nested loop is used. First, one loop goes through levels while the second goes through nodes. Time complexity is
O(n) and increases with the number of nodes on the tree linearly.
