The test cases I ran were as follows
  //TEST CASES
  //check their examples
  //all even
  //all odd 
  //empty list

If it was an all even list I expected every value to be sumed which happened
If it was an all odd list I expected a sum of 0 which happened
The examples given also returned the expected values and when the list was empty I got 0 as a returned sum.

I wrote my code in Cloud 9 and everything shoudl work/complie.
