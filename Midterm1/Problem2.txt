The test cases I ran were as follows
//TEST CASES
//test normal ist
//test empty list
//check just even list
//check just odd list
//check if the entered values are not integers


I checked first a noraml list with both even and odd numbers and they were sorted correctly
I then checked an empty list and my function printed the list was empty and displayed an empty list
Then i check just and even list and the odd list was null while the even one had the values in the original linked list
I did the same with an odd list next
then i made sure my function could handle any invalid input

I wrote my code in Cloud 9 and everything should work/compile.
